README for Amazing Project:

In order to run Amazing Project from terminal, it requires three additional inputs.
The first is a number of avatars, the second is the difficulty, and the third is the
host ip (host flume: 129.170.214.115). If the host is put incorrectly, Our program will
display an error to the user. The server will tell us if the other two arguments are invalid. Other
errors from the server are caught in AMClient based upon the message type sent from the server
and are dealt with accordingly.

The testing files for this project were written to the testing directory and are disitingushed
by nAvatars and difficulty.
